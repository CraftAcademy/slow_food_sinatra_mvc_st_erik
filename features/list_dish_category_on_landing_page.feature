# Feature: Dish categories
#   As a restaurant owner
#   So that customers can make specific orders
#   I want to have the dishes categorised
#   Scenario: So that customers can order food via category
#     Given there is a dish with a category of "Main"
#     And there is a dish with a category of "Dessert"
#     And there is a dish with a category of "Starter"
#     When I visit the site
#     Then I see a dish with a category of "Main"
#     And I see a dish with a category of "Dessert"
#     And I see a dish with a category of "Starter"
#     Then show me the page
